# MindSync

MindSync is a comprehensive application designed to address mental health concerns among employees by leveraging cutting-edge technology and insightful data analysis. Our solution comprises three core components:

## Frontend/UI
The UI offers an intuitive dashboard catering to organizations and their employees. It provides health insights through interactive graphs and plots. Key features include an attendance system, a chat application for seamless communication, survey forms, and engaging employee programs. Crafted with HTML, CSS, ReactJS, and ChartJS, the UI ensures a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.

## Backend
The backbone of our application, the backend, efficiently manages data flow between the UI and the AI server. Developed using TypeScript and Node.js, it serves as an intermediary, enabling smooth communication and proficient data management with the database.

## AI Server
The AI server acts as a central hub for data processing, hosting Large Language Model (LLM) models trained on diverse datasets. These models predict critical health metrics like stress levels, mood, and emotions based on employee-specific data. Powered by FastAPI and Python, the AI server offers advanced capabilities to provide precise and insightful health assessments.

## Integration Capability
Our application seamlessly integrates with third-party applications such as Slack and Jira, collecting text data related to employees. This functionality enables a comprehensive analysis of employee interactions and activities within the organization.

## Market Gap
MindSync addresses a significant gap in the market by effectively leveraging AI to detect and address mental health issues among employees. Its unique approach offers advanced AI techniques for insightful health assessments and support.
